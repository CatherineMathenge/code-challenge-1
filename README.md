## Description 1

The Student Grade Generator is a program that prompts the user to input a student's marks then generates a grade based on the input. For the program to work the input should be between 0 and 100. A grade is assigned based on the following criteria:

A: Scores of 80 or above 
B: Scores of 60 to 79 
C: Scores of 50 to 59 
D: Scores of 40 to 49 
E: Scores of 40 or less

#Description 2
The Speed Generator is a program that prompts the user to input the speed of a car. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 90, it should print: “Points: 4”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

#Description 3
The Net Salary Calculator is a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 


 
## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
In order to run the program, you will need :
A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code.) to write and edit the code.
A terminal to run the program.
Once you have a text editor and a terminal, you will  create a new file and write the code for the "Grade Generator", "Speed Detector" and "NetSalarycalculator" toy problem in Javascript.

### Installation
Inorder to install and and set up the project locally, the following commands should be done:

1.clone the project from the repository.

2.Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Enter the followig commands:
code .
git clone

3.Install the project dependencies in the Vscode by running the following command:
npm install
npm test

4.Create a separate html file to help run the prompt when you go live.


### Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run either of the three projects using the following command :
node nameofproject.js or Go live to run the program from a web browser.


This command will start the application and prompt you to enter either the grade, the speed or the basic salary.


The application will calculate:
The student grade based on the marks provided
The points earned based on the speed provided
The gross salary, payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, and net salary based on the provided basic salary.
