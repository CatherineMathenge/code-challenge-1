## Description 1

The Student Grade Generator is a program that prompts the user to input a student's marks then generates a grade based on the input. For the program to work the input should be between 0 and 100. A grade is assigned based on the following criteria:

A: Scores of 80 or above 
B: Scores of 60 to 79 
C: Scores of 50 to 59 
D: Scores of 40 to 49 
E: Scores of 40 or less

#Description 2
The Speed Generator is a program that prompts the user to input the speed of a car. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 90, it should print: “Points: 4”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

#Description 3
The Net Salary Calculator is a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
